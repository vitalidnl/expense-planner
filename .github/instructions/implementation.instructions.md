When implementing the tasks, please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Follow the coding style and conventions of the chosen language/framework.
- Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments and documentation.
- Ensure that your implementation meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the project documentation.
- Write unit tests for your code to ensure correctness and facilitate future maintenance.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your code changes and collaborate with others.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions about the requirements, please reach out to the project maintainers for clarification.
- When submitting your implementation, provide a clear and concise description of the changes you made and how they address the requirements.
- Ensure that your implementation does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
- If applicable, include instructions on how to run and test your implementation for reviewers.
- Keep in mind the overall architecture and design of the application, and strive for consistency across your implementation.
- Prioritize functionality and correctness over optimization, but be mindful of potential performance bottlenecks.
- If your implementation includes any third-party libraries or dependencies, ensure that they are properly documented and compatible with the project.
