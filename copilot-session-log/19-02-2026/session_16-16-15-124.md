## Conversation

### User
Find all issues on github for expense-planner repository marked with labels M1, M2, M3 and remove that labels from issues.

### Assistant
I'll help you find and remove those labels from GitHub issues. Let me start by getting your GitHub information and then searching for issues with those labels.

[Searching and processing results...]

Found all issues with M1, M2, and M3 labels. Now removing the labels:

**Issues found:**
- M1: Issue #10
- M2: Issues #11, #12, #14
- M3: Issues #16, #17, #18

[Removing labels...]

Done! I've successfully removed the M1, M2, and M3 labels from all 7 issues in the expense-planner repository:

| Label | Issues Removed From |
|-------|-------------------|
| **M1** | #10 |
| **M2** | #11, #12, #14 |
| **M3** | #16, #17, #18 |

All issues now retain only the "BACK" label.
